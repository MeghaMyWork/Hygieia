## About Hygieia
Hygieia dashboard is a single, configurable, easy-to-use dashboard to visualize near real-time status of the entire delivery pipeline. In addition, it provides a continuous feedback loop for any DevOps organization.

Hygieia dashboards are customizable: you can select your story tracking tools, code repository, users can select VersionOne or Jira for story tracking, Subversion or GitHub as repositories, Jenkins/Hudson for builds, Selenium and SonarQube for quality, uDeploy and Jenkins for deployment. More plugins are available.

Hygieia dashboards assist in achieving process transparency and therefore help establish feedback loops that are the underlying concept of lean and DevOps. They contain interactive elements which enable drill-down and linking to the connected tools.
